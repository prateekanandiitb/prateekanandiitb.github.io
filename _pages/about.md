Our group studies the **dynamics of anisotropic particles** suspended in fluid flows — a key problem in understanding the **microphysics of complex suspensions**. Such systems are found across nature and industry, ranging from **blood and pulp suspensions** all the way to clouds that play a crucial role in the earth-atmosphere radiation budget.

We use **theoretical models** and **numerical simulations** to investigate how particle orientation and motion influence **rheology, viscosity, and optical properties**. Our research lies at the intersection of **fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and computational physics**, aiming to bridge microscopic particle behavior with macroscopic flow phenomena.

## Research Themes

- **Migration of particles in channel flows**  

- **Motion of anisotropic particles in turbulence**  
  
- **Beyond perturbation: Homotopy Analysis methods in fluid dynamics**  

---

## Approach and Philosophy

We believe that impactful engineering research arises from **rigorous fundamentals** connected to **technological relevance**.  
Our approach emphasizes:

- Integration of analytical, computational, and experimental insights.
- Open, reproducible research practices.
- Collaboration across disciplines — spanning applied mathematics and fluid dynamics

Our long-term vision is to **translate fundamental fluids into tangible technologies** that address challenges in energy, environment, and health.
