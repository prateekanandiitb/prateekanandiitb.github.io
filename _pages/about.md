Our lab investigates the physics of **fluid–particle interactions**, **inertial migration**, and **thermal transport phenomena** in complex flow environments. We aim to uncover how microscopic flow structures give rise to emergent macroscopic behavior — insights that inform the design of efficient **microfluidic systems**, **heat exchangers**, and **next-generation energy technologies**.

We combine theory, computation, and experiments to develop predictive models that bridge scales and guide practical applications in engineering and science.

## Research Themes

- **Inertial Migration and Particle Dynamics**  
  Exploring how rigid and deformable particles migrate and self-organize in confined and wall-bounded flows, with implications for microfluidic manipulation and diagnostics.

- **Micro- and Mesoscale Transport Phenomena**  
  Studying heat, mass, and momentum transfer in microchannels and structured surfaces to enhance performance in thermal management and energy devices.

- **Computational Fluid Mechanics**  
  Developing high-fidelity simulation frameworks and reduced-order models for complex, multiphase, and particle-laden flows.

- **Translational Thermal Science**  
  Bridging fundamental discoveries in fluid and thermal sciences with practical technology — from microfluidic devices to advanced cooling systems.

## Approach and Philosophy

We believe that impactful engineering research arises from **rigorous fundamentals** connected to **technological relevance**.  
Our approach emphasizes:

- Integration of analytical, computational, and experimental insights.
- Open, reproducible research practices.
- Collaboration across disciplines — spanning applied mathematics, materials science, and bioengineering.

Our long-term vision is to **translate fundamental fluid and thermal science into tangible technologies** that address challenges in energy, environment, and health.
